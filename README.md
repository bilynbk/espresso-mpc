Install Raspbian and configure Wi-Fi and timezone.

Installation Instructions
--------------------------
Execute on the pi bash shell:
````
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo rpi-update
sudo bash -c 'echo "dtparam=spi=on" >> /boot/config.txt'
sudo reboot
````

After reboot
--------------
````
sudo git clone https://github.com/martinandreasson/espresso-mpc.git /root/espresso-mpc
sudo /root/espresso-mpc/setup.sh
````
This last step will download the necessariy python libraries and install the espresso-mpc software in /root/espresso-mpc

It also creates an entry in /etc/rc.local to start the software on every boot.
